# uniqode

Transpiles uni*code* into CoffeeScript and adds a very thin layer of syntactic sugar to CoffeeScript.

### Main features
* Allows source code to include any unicode character
* Improved (or at least extended) dot and array notation (see examples below)

### Unicode examples

(this was written before I had the idea of improved dot notation...)

```
# The following...

price =
  $: 10
  â‚¬: 9.1
  Â£: 6.7
  Â¥: 1209
  
# ...should result in:

price =
  $: 10         # Yupp, as all jQuery and AngularJS users know, '$' is valid...
  x20AC: 9.1    # Option 1: hex
  d165: 6.7     # Option 2: decimal
  nYen: 1209    # Option 3: name
  
# Other example: show USD price in EUR
$â†’â‚¬ = 10/9
console.log price * $â†’â‚¬

# JavaScript output:
$_x2192_x20AC = 10/9
console.log(price * $_x2192_x20AC)



# Cooler examples:

# Likes and comments
console.log blog.posts[3]    # I realize you won't be able to output
> {â™¥: 2661, âœŽ: 121}          # unicode characters to the console

# Sub/superscript
room.size =
  mÂ²: 20
  ftÂ²: 215.28
  
# Gamepad
if â†‘ then jump
if â†“ then crouch
if â†“â†˜â†’ and ðŸ‘Š then Ryu.hadouken()

# Maths
âˆ‘ = 0
for number in series
  âˆ‘ += number

# Music
melody = [
  [ â™ª('D'), â™ª('G') ],
  [ â™ª('F'), â™ª('Bb') ],      # Smoke on the water,
  [ â™©('G'), â™©('C') ],       # in case you're wondering...
]                       

# Making amends...
friends.ðŸ˜Š += 1
friends.ðŸ˜¡ -= 1
  
```

### Dot notation
```
# Replace dot with pipe for clarity and beauty (clarity == beauty)

person.name = 'John'
person | name = 'John'

# Replace array [] with #
blog.post[3].likes += 1
blog | post #3 | â™¥ += 1     # No white space allowed. 'post # 3' will result in comment ('# 3')

# 

```

### Status
Untested idea...
